# **Golang RAG/LLM framework with Memory and Transcriber - All-in-One Platform**
  

This project is an easy to use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system that combines an **LLM client with memory**, **text embedding**, and **document transcription** in a single easy-to-configure platform  framework over [LangChain Go](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo).

It offers seamless **compatibility with OLLAMA and OpenAI**, making it an excellent choice for chatbot applications.

  

## **Features**

  

1.  **LLM Client - Sync and Stream with High Compatibility**

- Supports both synchronous and streaming interactions with LLMs.

- Fully compatible with **OLLAMA** and **OpenAI**, ensuring smooth chatbot integration.

  

2.  **Text Embedding & Similarity Search**

- Efficient document embedding and retrieval using **Cosine Similarity** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

- Powered by **Redis Vector Store** for fast lookups.

  


3.  **Document Transcription**
- Internet content downloader
- Processes files such as PDFs, Word, Excel, and HTML using **Apache Tika**.

- Extracts structured data, including OCR-based transcription for scanned documents.
  

4.  **Multilingual Support**

- Process and analyze content in multiple languages with AI-powered detection and response customization.

  

5.  **Scalability**

- Leverages Redis and efficient text processing pipelines to scale with large datasets.

  

## **Configuration**

  


  

Configure environment variables in `.env` file:

  

```env

APITOKEN=your-openai-api-token //not mandatory for Ollama

REDIS_HOST=localhost:6379

REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

TIKA_URL=http://localhost:9998/tika //not mandatory for text and html usage

```

  

## **Usage**

  
Refer to the [examples](https://github.com/RezaArani/aillm/tree/master/examples) folder in the repository for more details. Below is a simple usage example:



  

```go
//define client 
llmclient := &aillm.OllamaController{
		Config: aillm.LLMConfig{
			Apiurl:  "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
			AiModel: "llama3.1",
		},
	}
 // basic configuration like Redis server host and password
	llm := aillm.LLMContainer{
		Embedder:  llmclient,
		LLMClient: llmclient,
		DataRedis: aillm.RedisClient{
			Host: "localhost:6379",
		},
	}
	llm.Init()
	//index name
	embeddingId := "MyId"
	// document title for future calls or remove
	embeddingTitle := "SemMapas Contents"
 	
 	// Text Embedding
	contents := make(map[string]aillm.LLMEmbeddingContent)
	contents["en"] = aillm.LLMEmbeddingContent{
		Text: `Welcome to SemMapas, your strategic partner in enhancing local engagement and tourism development. Designed specifically for businesses and municipalities, SemMapas offers a powerful platform to connect with residents and visitors alike, driving growth and prosperity in your community.

`,
	}

	llm.EmbeddText(EmbeddingId, Title, contents)
 	// time to call LLM, Now it knows what is SemMapas
	askKLLM(llm, embeddingId, "en", "User1", "What is SemMapas?")


```

  

## **TODO**

  

- Implement **parallelism** to optimize processing efficiency.

- Improve **context management** to enhance memory retention and retrieval capabilities.

- Enhance the chatbot integration by supporting additional LLM models.
- Dockerized version with Reset Service and Websocket web server.
