# **Golang RAG/LLM framework with Memory and Transcriber - All-in-One Platform**
  

This project is an easy to use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system that combines an **LLM client with memory**, **text embedding**, and **document transcription** in a single easy-to-configure platform  framework over [LangChain Go](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo).

It offers seamless **compatibility with OLLAMA and OpenAI**, making it an excellent choice for chatbot applications.

  

## **Features**
 

1.  **LLM Client - Sync and Stream with High Compatibility**

- Supports both synchronous and streaming interactions with LLMs.

- Fully compatible with **OLLAMA** and **OpenAI**, ensuring smooth chatbot integration.

  

2.  **Text Embedding & Similarity Search**

- Efficient document embedding and retrieval using **Cosine Similarity** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

- Powered by **Redis Vector Store** for fast lookups.


3.  **Document Transcription and Image description generation**
- Internet content downloader
- Processes files such as PDFs, Word, Excel, and HTML using **Apache Tika**.
- Extracts structured data, including OCR-based transcription for scanned documents.
- Ability to call multimodal models for describing images.
  

4.  **Multilingual Support**

- Process and analyze content in multiple languages with AI-powered detection and response customization.

  

5.  **Memory Management**

- Leverages Redis and efficient text processing pipelines to scale with large datasets.
- **Memory Summarization** for condensing long conversation histories.
- Vector search for retrieving relevant past interactions.

  

## **Configuration**
Configure environment variables in `.env` file:
```env
APITOKEN=your-openai-api-token //not mandatory for Ollama
REDIS_HOST=localhost:6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
TIKA_URL=http://localhost:9998/tika //not mandatory for text, html or multimodal model usage and should be used just for PDF,MS-Word, MS-Excel & ...
```

  

## **Usage**

  
Refer to the [examples](https://github.com/RezaArani/aillm/tree/master/examples) folder in the repository for more details. Below is a simple usage example:



  

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	aillm "github.com/RezaArani/aillm/controller"
)

func main() {
	log.Println("Testing aillm framework:")
	// locally hosted ollama
	llmclient := &aillm.OllamaController{
		Config: aillm.LLMConfig{
			Apiurl:  "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
			AiModel: "llama3.1",
		},
	}
	// Create an LLM instance with OllamaClient
	llm := aillm.LLMContainer{
		Embedder:  llmclient,
		LLMClient: llmclient,
		RedisClient: aillm.RedisClient{
			Host: "localhost:6379",
		},
	}
	
	llm.Init()
	// asking question without context
	askKLLM(llm, "What is SemMapas?")
	// let's embed some data
	log.Println("Embedding:")
	embedd(llm)
	
	// Time for asking some questions
	askKLLM(llm, "What is SemMapas?")
	askKLLM(llm, "Where did it launched?")
	// Now removing embedded data and asking the same question, result should be I'm unable to provide a specific location regarding the launch of SemMapas as I don't have sufficient information on this topic.
	llm.RemoveEmbedding("")
	// Asking the same question again
	
}

func askKLLM(llm aillm.LLMContainer,query string) {
	log.Println("LLM Reply to " + query + ":")
	_, err := llm.AskLLM(query, llm.WithStreamingFunc(print))
 	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
 
func embedd(llm aillm.LLMContainer) {
	// Text Embedding
	contents := aillm.LLMEmbeddingContent{
		Text: enRawText,
	}
	llm.EmbeddText("", contents)
}

func print(ctx context.Context, chunk []byte) error {
	fmt.Print(string(chunk))
	return nil
}

const enRawText = `Welcome to SemMapas, your strategic partner in enhancing local engagement and tourism development.

## **Image Description Example**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	aillm "github.com/RezaArani/aillm/controller"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize with a vision-capable model
	llmclient := &aillm.OpenAIController{
		Config: aillm.LLMConfig{
			Apiurl:   "https://api.openai.com/v1",
			AiModel:  "gpt-4-vision-preview",
			APIToken: "your-openai-api-token",
		},
	}
	
	llm := aillm.LLMContainer{
		VisionClient: llmclient,
	}
	
	llm.Init()
	
	// Describe an image from a file
	response, err := llm.DescribeImageFromFile("path/to/your/image.jpg", "What can you see in this image?")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error: %v", err)
	}
	
	fmt.Println("Image Description:", response.Choices[0].Message.Content)
}
```
